# Kidney-Disease-Prediction
This project builds a tool to predict kidney disease using machine learning. We use data from patient medical records, including information like blood pressure, sugar levels, and red blood cell count. A special algorithm called RandomForestClassifier learns from this data to identify patterns that indicate kidney disease.
