# Kidney Disease Analysis

This project aims to analyze a dataset related to kidney disease and build a predictive model using machine learning.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains information about various factors related to kidney disease, including blood pressure, sugar levels, red blood cell count, and more. It is named 'kidney_disease.csv'.

## Methodology

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
    - Loading the dataset from the 'kidney_disease.csv' file using Pandas.
    - Handling missing values by imputing with mean or mode.
    - Encoding categorical variables using Label Encoding.

2. **Feature Engineering (Optional):**
   - Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance (if needed).
   - Adding small random noise to the dataset using numpy to test the model's robustness

3. **Model Building:**
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
   - Training a RandomForestClassifier model on the training data.
   - Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy and other relevant metrics.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of ... (Insert the actual accuracy score here).

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Upload the dataset (`kidney_disease.csv`) to your Colab environment.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the analysis.
3. Adjust hyperparameters and features as needed to improve model performance.
